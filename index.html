      <!-- First -->
      <div class="bg-text" data-aos="flip-down" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h3>Many people feel that animated movies are primarily made for children and cannot be as poignant as non-animated movies.</h3>
        <h4 class="floating">Why do you think this is? Explain why you agree or disagree with this viewpoint.</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          Well, I agree to that because animated movies have less stuff that children shouldn't see such as blood and gore, it could be more catered toward children and so it would
          be less entertaining then for older people when they know it's just going to be a happy ending.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Second -->
      <div class="bg-text" data-aos="flip-down" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h3>An animated character's pose has the ability to non-verbally communicate a lot and the same is true in real life.</h3>
        <h4 class="floating">
          Briefly describe three different circumstances when a person's pose non-verbally communicates what they are thinking or feeling. Be sure to indicate what feeling each
          pose expresses.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          When someone is shivering, they feel cold. When someone is looking below eye level and walking slowly somewhere, it usually means they are sad or down. When you look up
          and someone is staring at you, and you notice their eyes are concentrated on you but they are moving their eye, repetitively towards something else, it means that they
          are trying to show you something.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Third -->
      <div class="bg-text" data-aos="flip-down" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h3>
            Is it possible to create believable animated characters with no prior knowledge of human anatomy or body mechanics?

        </h3>
        <h4 class="floating">Why or why not?</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          I think it is not because you will need to understand how the body moves, how different body language converts into different moods. You could make a mistake and have the guys face smiling but the body language shows that he is sad.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Fourth -->
      <div class="bg-text" data-aos="flip-down" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h3>
          You've learned the importance of observing and studying the human body and real-life movement to help draw believable characters, but do you think the same applies to
          inanimate objects?
        </h3>
        <h4 class="floating">Is it necessary to study and observe stationary objects to better your drawing of them? Explain.</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          I think it does apply to inanimate objects because it is still something you have to draw, and you still might forget something because you have a lot of feature to draw
          but other might notice as soon as you show them. Believe me, it's happened to me
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Fifth -->
      <div class="bg-text" data-aos="flip-down" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h3>What are some of the drawing practices suggested in the unit that might also be useful for a screenwriter or novelist?.</h3>
        <h4 class="floating">Explain.</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          Exaggerating facial features is one of them, it would be helpful for a screenwriter so then he can give directions to cry or something and captivate the audience.
